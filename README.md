# Gravity-Simulator
This is an educational app made in QB64 that allows students to see and interact with three introductory simulations.  It was created for SpaceAthon 2023.  It allows students to build a connection with the deep nature of gravity and build an intuition behind how it works.  It also prompts students with technical questions to sharpen their mathematical skills.  A demonstration can be found at https://youtu.be/xJxP5pKicCs.
